This is the old 201509_python_exercises_generator cvs repository
renamed and moved git.

It is was renamed to the more general name questions_transformer
because it is used to transform python questions but also other
questions like mathematics ones.

To use this package add the path to where you installed it in your
system to your Python sys.path. For exemple,

sys.path.append('/home/jbs/develop/201902_questions_transformer')
